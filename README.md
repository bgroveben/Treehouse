## Courses from [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home).  

[Las Vegas-Clark County Library District](http://www.lvccld.org/) offers a FREE Treehouse subscription to local residents with an active Resident LVCCLD library card. This is an example of taxpayer money that is well spent. Check out (pun intended) the [LVCCLD Limitless Learning](http://hottopics.lvccld.org/learn/limitless_learning) page for details.  

### Info About This Repository:  

Treehouse organizes their courses based on [Tracks](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks), so that is the model I will follow for now.  
I'm currently working on the [Learn Python Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-python).
